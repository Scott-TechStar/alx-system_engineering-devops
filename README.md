# Alx System Engineering DevOps

This repository contains programs written for the alx-system_engineering-DevOps
track at ALX School. These projects, which began occurring in the month
2 of the curriculum, I'm learning development tricks professionally.
Simultaneously, I continued reinforcing and expanding my C, ruby, and shell
scripting skills. The specific list of projects contained as follows:

* [0x00 Shell basics](./0x00-shell_basics)

* [0x01 Shell permissions](./0x01-shell_permissions)

* [0x02 Shell redirections](./0x02-shell_redirections)

* [0x03 Shell variables expansions](./0x03-shell_variables_expansions)
  
* [0x04 Loops conditions and parsing](./0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing)

* [0x05 Processes and signals](./0x05-processes_and_signals)

* [0x06 Regular expressions](./0x06-regular_expressions)

* [0x07 Networking basics #0](./0x07-networking_basics)
